Hello and welcome to Unit testing for unity.

00:03.260 --> 00:09.230
Here we're going to be talking about artificial intelligence and how it can be used for production code

00:09.230 --> 00:10.730
and for unit testing code.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.600
AI is an especially hot topic, and as game developers, we're interested in how AI can help us build

00:17.600 --> 00:21.080
projects and be used at runtime for our projects.

00:21.110 --> 00:24.500
In this section, I'll give a brief introduction to the topic.

00:24.500 --> 00:31.010
Then look at the specific subtopics of AI for production code and treat that separately.

00:31.010 --> 00:35.210
Then AI for writing your unit tests about your production code.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.830
There's also an opportunity for more topics and expanding after that.

00:40.010 --> 00:44.660
AI has been a part of game development since the beginning of game dev itself.

00:44.690 --> 00:51.530
In the last year or so, we've seen an explosive growth in the topic in pop culture, social media,

00:51.530 --> 00:53.980
as well as in the game dev community itself.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.810
There's an awesome website that I like to check out called.

00:56.810 --> 01:03.680
There's an AI for that link below, and you can see how AI can enable all sorts of different industries,

01:03.680 --> 01:04.970
including game dev.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.390
As with all things software, game dev will be forever changed as this AI technology grows.

01:11.420 --> 01:17.540
Game developers who embrace this technology and are able to use the tools well will continue to compete

01:17.540 --> 01:18.500
in the workplace.

01:18.530 --> 01:19.520
Let's read here.

01:19.550 --> 01:24.660
A game developer is responsible for creating and designing video games for various platforms.

01:24.680 --> 01:30.200
They work closely with different disciplines game developers using programming language and software

01:30.200 --> 01:33.560
to create engaging and interactive experiences for their players.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.050
Now in all of this, we can use AI.

01:36.140 --> 01:41.750
Let's see how incorporating AI into unity game development in particular, can streamline development

01:41.750 --> 01:42.590
and testing.

01:42.590 --> 01:48.440
Some of the benefits include content generation, assist in creating the assets such as the textures

01:48.440 --> 01:52.430
and models, and speeding up the asset creation process overall.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.130
There's cogeneration as well, analyzing, suggesting designs for new systems.

01:58.160 --> 02:04.550
Optimizing, making your systems more efficient leads to better performance in your gameplay and reduce

02:04.550 --> 02:05.450
development time.

02:05.450 --> 02:09.320
And also of particular interest to this topic is automated testing.

02:09.530 --> 02:15.990
I can rapidly identify and fix the bugs, and also reduce the time it takes to create those unit tests.

02:16.010 --> 02:20.330
One of the amazing tools we've seen is OpenAI's ChatGPT.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.550
This feels like a text chat conversation with a friend, except it's an AI.

02:25.580 --> 02:29.900
You text chat, you get a response, and you can iterate on that conversation.

02:29.930 --> 02:35.810
The AI knows about all aspects of game development marketing, your game, coming up with game ideas,

02:35.810 --> 02:36.260
and more.

02:36.260 --> 02:41.750
When you're having that text conversation with the ChatGPT, you're giving it prompts or instructions,

02:41.750 --> 02:46.490
and there's lots of different cheat sheets like what we see here for how to make effective prompts.

02:46.490 --> 02:51.620
You might want to start the conversation by saying act like a unity game development expert.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.180
Tell me about this or that in C-sharp.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.120
That allows the AI to know how to best explain it.

02:57.140 --> 03:00.140
Another fantastic tool is GitHub's copilot.

03:00.170 --> 03:06.500
This is trained specifically on programming language material, and it knows everything about C-sharp

03:06.500 --> 03:08.040
and Unity that you'd want to know.

03:08.060 --> 03:13.850
Also, code editors that you use to type the code instructions into unity know about the specific context

03:13.850 --> 03:19.160
of the class that you're sitting in, so it can answer not just theoretical questions, but what would

03:19.160 --> 03:21.720
the next line of this page look like?

03:21.740 --> 03:26.570
And then it can fill out more of your code page to learn more about unit testing for unity.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.820
You can check out this great course link below, and this video will also be part of the course itself,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.730
with expanded chapters beyond this video itself.

03:34.730 --> 03:40.490
In the course we look at why unit testing is amazing tool, why it is going to help your game development,

03:40.520 --> 03:46.430
why it's a fantastic career building tool specifically for people in the mid to late phase of their

03:46.430 --> 03:46.970
career.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.050
Really giving you a way to compete in the workplace.

03:50.060 --> 03:54.470
Now, in the game development community, we have a variety of different peoples with different goals.

03:54.470 --> 03:58.880
Some are hobbyists just looking to have fun and be creative on nights and weekends.

03:58.910 --> 04:04.010
Others want to make a career out of it, or get a group of friends together and create a real project

04:04.010 --> 04:07.460
for moneymaking, really, across all those different user profiles.

04:07.490 --> 04:13.910
Adding unit testing into your workflow is fantastic, and being able to take advantage of AI to help

04:13.910 --> 04:16.880
you along with that process is a time saver.

04:16.880 --> 04:23.270
It's a great learning tool and it will make you a more competitive coworker in your industry in the

04:23.270 --> 04:23.630
course.

04:23.630 --> 04:29.180
In the next videos, we'll take a look exactly how this works inside the unity editor using the AI tools.

04:29.180 --> 04:30.110
Thanks.
