00:00.700 --> 00:04.180
The mini NBC's Sample Login project.

00:04.540 --> 00:11.290
With each sample project, there's an opportunity to peel back more of the layers in MVCs and think

00:11.290 --> 00:13.090
critically about these concepts.

00:13.090 --> 00:15.580
This will dramatically increase your learning.

00:15.610 --> 00:20.410
To kick start your thoughts, consider the pros and benefits of the framework in each sample.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.900
With which aspects are you feeling more comfortable?

00:22.900 --> 00:26.170
Are you beginning to see the long term benefits of choosing a framework?

00:26.170 --> 00:30.400
Which parts of the framework are you excited about and want to learn more along the way?

00:30.400 --> 00:33.310
You might identify some possible cons or drawbacks.

00:33.310 --> 00:36.670
Which aspects of the framework may not work for your needs?

00:36.670 --> 00:42.430
Is there anything you can do to get the results that you need and which patterns and practices remain

00:42.430 --> 00:43.420
unclear for you?

00:43.420 --> 00:44.920
Think about these points.

00:44.920 --> 00:50.590
Engage in the community, take notes and reflect as we're stepping into this sample will be in a project

00:50.590 --> 00:54.010
that has the source code for the framework as well as the samples.

00:54.130 --> 01:01.330
Each of the samples we cover has a version with many MVCs and without the user login sample project

01:01.330 --> 01:05.520
levels up the complexity a little bit from the previous sample.

01:05.530 --> 01:11.260
Here we have a view rendering unity UI and we're also capturing user input.

01:11.260 --> 01:18.670
This sample also introduces one mono behavior used in the view, while still relatively simple and targeting

01:18.670 --> 01:20.050
an audience of beginners.

01:20.050 --> 01:22.000
We'll see some new concepts here.

01:22.830 --> 01:28.510
As we're digging into this sample, consider which of these coding assignments you'd like to take on.

01:28.530 --> 01:31.320
There's a variety here, and you could even create your own.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.490
Starting with lower difficulty is just to explain back these concepts.

01:35.490 --> 01:39.730
After digging into the example, are you comfortable enough to explain it to a friend?

01:39.750 --> 01:41.610
Each sample includes unit testing.

01:41.610 --> 01:45.690
Can you add one more unit test that makes sense in the context of the sample?

01:45.690 --> 01:52.350
You can add a new UI feature, perhaps adding text or a button to the UI and then wiring it up properly

01:52.350 --> 01:54.150
in a way that makes sense to the framework.

01:54.150 --> 01:59.940
You could create some other type of new input, perhaps having keyboard input, do something appropriate

01:59.940 --> 02:00.720
for the sample.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.220
You could copy the sample.

02:02.220 --> 02:07.290
Perhaps the sample has some things that are interesting for a different use case copy and paste the

02:07.290 --> 02:13.500
entire parent folder, rename each class so that it's unique or give it a new namespace and then add

02:13.500 --> 02:15.810
and adjust the functionality to meet your needs.

02:15.810 --> 02:21.510
And perhaps the most challenging of this list would be to create a new sample yourself instead of copying

02:21.510 --> 02:22.290
and pasting.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.080
Here, begin with the empty canvas of a new project.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.230
Import the framework itself and start coding from scratch.

02:28.230 --> 02:32.040
That certainly demonstrates a firm grasp of all the concepts.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.900
Doing assignments like these helps to deepen your knowledge with practical experience.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.250
Let's see this in action.

02:38.250 --> 02:44.730
You can create a new Unity project, import the Mini NPCs Framework, import the samples, open this

02:44.730 --> 02:51.120
particular sample, explore the version within that doesn't use mini MVCs to gain the basic knowledge

02:51.120 --> 02:52.080
of how it operates.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.890
And then look at the version with many MVCs and with each sample.

02:55.890 --> 02:58.980
I'll do some live coding with one of the sample assignments.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.180
Let's get started.
