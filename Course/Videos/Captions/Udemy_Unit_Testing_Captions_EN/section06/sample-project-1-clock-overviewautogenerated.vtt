00:00.120 --> 00:03.030
The many NBC's Clock sample project.

00:03.030 --> 00:09.630
With each sample project, there's an opportunity to peel back more of the layers in MVCs and think

00:09.630 --> 00:11.460
critically about these concepts.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.930
This will dramatically increase your learning.

00:13.950 --> 00:18.750
To kick start your thoughts, consider the pros and benefits of the framework in each sample.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.240
With which aspects are you feeling more comfortable?

00:21.240 --> 00:24.510
Are you beginning to see the long term benefits of choosing a framework?

00:24.510 --> 00:28.740
Which parts of the framework are you excited about and want to learn more along the way?

00:28.740 --> 00:31.650
You might identify some possible cons or drawbacks.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.040
Which aspects of the framework may not work for your needs?

00:35.040 --> 00:40.770
Is there anything you can do to get the results that you need and which patterns and practices remain

00:40.770 --> 00:41.760
unclear for you?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.290
Think about these points.

00:43.290 --> 00:48.930
Engage in the community, take notes and reflect as we're stepping into this sample will be in a project

00:48.930 --> 00:52.380
that has the source code for the framework as well as the samples.

00:52.500 --> 00:57.330
Each of the samples we cover has a version with many MVCs and without.

00:57.330 --> 00:59.520
In this sample we're looking at a simple clock.

00:59.520 --> 01:05.300
It has no view and instead uses debug log statements to see some sort of output into the console window.

01:05.310 --> 01:07.410
This keeps the example especially simple.

01:07.410 --> 01:10.440
It has no mono behaviors and no input either.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.230
As we're digging into this sample, consider which of these coding assignments you'd like to take on.

01:16.230 --> 01:19.020
There's a variety here and you could even create your own.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.190
Starting with lower difficulty is just to explain back these concepts.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.450
After digging into the example, are you comfortable enough to explain it to a friend?

01:27.450 --> 01:29.310
Each sample includes unit testing.

01:29.310 --> 01:33.390
Can you add one more unit test that makes sense in the context of the sample?

01:33.390 --> 01:40.050
You can add a new UI feature, perhaps adding text or a button to the UI and then wiring it up properly

01:40.050 --> 01:41.850
in a way that makes sense to the framework.

01:41.850 --> 01:47.640
You could create some other type of new input, perhaps having keyboard input, do something appropriate

01:47.640 --> 01:48.420
for the sample.

01:48.420 --> 01:49.920
You could copy the sample.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.990
Perhaps the sample has some things that are interesting for a different use case copy and paste the

01:54.990 --> 02:01.200
entire parent folder, rename each class so that it's unique or give it a new namespace and then add

02:01.200 --> 02:03.510
and adjust the functionality to meet your needs.

02:03.510 --> 02:09.210
And perhaps the most challenging of this list would be to create a new sample yourself instead of copying

02:09.210 --> 02:09.960
and pasting.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.750
Here, begin with the empty canvas of a new project.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.930
Import the framework itself and start coding from scratch.

02:15.930 --> 02:19.740
That certainly demonstrates a firm grasp of all the concepts.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.600
Doing assignments like these helps to deepen your knowledge with practical experience.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.930
Let's see this in action You can create a new Unity project.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.420
Import the Mini MVCs Framework.

02:30.420 --> 02:36.810
Import the samples, open this particular sample, explore the version within that doesn't use mini

02:36.810 --> 02:39.780
MVCs to gain the basic knowledge of how it operates.

02:39.780 --> 02:45.360
And then look at the version with many MVCs and with each sample, I'll do some live coding with one

02:45.360 --> 02:46.680
of the sample assignments.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.910
Let's get started.
