00:00.270 --> 00:03.750
The Mini MVCs Rollerball Sample Project.

00:04.580 --> 00:11.300
With each sample project, there's an opportunity to peel back more of the layers in MVCs and think

00:11.300 --> 00:13.090
critically about these concepts.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.590
This will dramatically increase your learning.

00:15.620 --> 00:20.390
To kick start your thoughts, consider the pros and benefits of the framework in each sample.

00:20.390 --> 00:22.900
With which aspects are you feeling more comfortable?

00:22.910 --> 00:26.180
Are you beginning to see the long term benefits of choosing a framework?

00:26.180 --> 00:30.410
Which parts of the framework are you excited about and want to learn more along the way?

00:30.410 --> 00:33.290
You might identify some possible cons or drawbacks.

00:33.290 --> 00:36.680
Which aspects of the framework may not work for your needs?

00:36.680 --> 00:42.410
Is there anything you can do to get the results that you need and which patterns and practices remain

00:42.410 --> 00:43.430
unclear for you?

00:43.430 --> 00:44.930
Think about these points.

00:44.930 --> 00:50.570
Engage in the community, take notes and reflect as we're stepping into this sample will be in a project

00:50.570 --> 00:54.020
that has the source code for the framework as well as the samples.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.000
Each of the samples we cover has a version with many MVCs and without.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.790
With the Rollerball sample, we see a simple complete three D game includes audio UI input and physics.

01:07.790 --> 01:13.490
From an architectural standpoint, we'll see a bit more complexity than we've seen in previous samples.

01:13.490 --> 01:19.340
Here we have multiple views and multiple controllers showing the scalability of the framework.

01:19.340 --> 01:24.050
And with its integration into unity, we see multiple mono behaviors in use as well.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.640
Due to the added complexity here, the target audience is intermediate developers.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.890
If you followed along well with the previous samples, this is a great opportunity to learn even more.

01:33.890 --> 01:39.620
As we're digging into this sample, consider which of these coding assignments you'd like to take on.

01:39.620 --> 01:42.410
There's a variety here and you could even create your own.

01:42.410 --> 01:46.580
Starting with lower difficulty is just to explain back these concepts.

01:46.580 --> 01:50.860
After digging into the example, are you comfortable enough to explain it to a friend?

01:50.870 --> 01:52.700
Each sample includes unit testing.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.780
Can you add one more unit test that makes sense in the context of the sample?

01:56.780 --> 02:03.440
You can add a new UI feature, perhaps adding text or a button to the UI and then wiring it up properly

02:03.440 --> 02:05.240
in a way that makes sense to the framework.

02:05.240 --> 02:11.030
You could create some other type of new input, perhaps having keyboard input, do something appropriate

02:11.030 --> 02:11.810
for the sample.

02:11.810 --> 02:13.340
You could copy the sample.

02:13.340 --> 02:18.410
Perhaps the sample has some things that are interesting for a different use case copy and paste the

02:18.410 --> 02:24.590
entire parent folder, rename each class so that it's unique or give it a new namespace and then add

02:24.590 --> 02:26.900
and adjust the functionality to meet your needs.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.600
And perhaps the most challenging of this list would be to create a new sample yourself instead of copying

02:32.600 --> 02:33.380
and pasting.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.140
Here, begin with the empty canvas of a new project.

02:36.140 --> 02:39.320
Import the framework itself and start coding from scratch.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.130
That certainly demonstrates a firm grasp of all the concepts.

02:43.130 --> 02:48.020
Doing assignments like these helps to deepen your knowledge with practical experience.

02:48.020 --> 02:53.810
Let's see this in action You can create a new Unity project, import the mini and framework.

02:53.810 --> 03:00.200
Import the samples, Open this particular sample, explore the version within that doesn't use mini

03:00.200 --> 03:03.170
MVCs to gain the basic knowledge of how it operates.

03:03.170 --> 03:06.980
And then look at the version with many MVCs and with each sample.

03:06.980 --> 03:10.100
I'll do some live coding with one of the sample assignments.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.300
Let's get started.
