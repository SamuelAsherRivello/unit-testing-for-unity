00:00.300 --> 00:02.130
The course philosophy.

00:03.410 --> 00:10.220
This course was born out of the idea that we all start our software projects with the best of intentions,

00:10.340 --> 00:15.620
but somehow we end up with software that is difficult to scale and to maintain.

00:16.040 --> 00:23.300
It said that we don't rise to the level of our expectations, but instead we fall to the level of our

00:23.300 --> 00:23.860
training.

00:23.870 --> 00:31.460
This course is designed to give us the training to build software with confidence, performance and

00:31.460 --> 00:32.470
scalability.

00:32.480 --> 00:38.780
Completing this training and integrating it into your workflow will greatly impact the projects you

00:38.780 --> 00:42.050
create and the quality of life for you and your team.

00:42.050 --> 00:43.640
Your team will Thank you.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.720
Some advice to get the most out of this course.

00:47.750 --> 00:55.310
Be active, watch the videos as well as doing the quizzes and the assignments in the moments the course

00:55.310 --> 01:03.290
calls for it, Download the source code, follow along and play with the code experiment, add new features

01:03.290 --> 01:07.060
and bring the theory from the course into practice within the code.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.290
This course covers a lot of topics.

01:09.290 --> 01:13.790
Feel free to take breaks whenever you need so that you get the most out of the material.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.670
Do your best to pull this information toward you.

01:16.670 --> 01:23.420
If there's concepts, topics, APIs that are mentioned that you're not familiar with, feel free to

01:23.420 --> 01:28.610
pause the video and investigate a bit on your own and then move forward with the course.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.310
I'm really excited to share this information with you.

01:31.310 --> 01:32.420
Let's get started.
