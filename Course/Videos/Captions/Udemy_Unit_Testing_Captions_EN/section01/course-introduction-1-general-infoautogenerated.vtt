Hello and welcome to MVC Architecture for Unity.

00:07.460 --> 00:08.350
Hello.

00:08.360 --> 00:09.290
I'm Sam.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.390
I'll be leading you through this course.

00:11.720 --> 00:16.280
I'm a unity certified developer with over 20 years of experience.

00:16.310 --> 00:21.020
My mission is to educate and entertain with interactive technology.

00:21.050 --> 00:25.910
I've shipped Unity game titles for PC console and mobile platforms.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.820
I'm especially excited to bring you this course.

00:28.820 --> 00:35.270
It's a fantastic way for intermediate and advanced developers to level up their skill set in a way that

00:35.270 --> 00:36.110
matters.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.140
Architecture is tremendously important.

00:39.530 --> 00:43.730
Over my career, I've had varied experiences just within unity.

00:43.730 --> 00:49.970
I've worked in education, teaching at universities, and making online courses like this one shipping

00:49.970 --> 00:57.860
game titles for mobile console PC, as well as working on educational materials for unity tools and

00:57.860 --> 01:00.170
different Unity game development companies.

01:00.530 --> 01:03.410
Welcome to MVC Architecture for Unity.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.670
Unity is a versatile game engine.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.830
It can be used for all sorts of projects, including, of course, games.

01:10.010 --> 01:17.840
The MVC architecture, which stands for Model, View and controller, brings confidence, organization

01:17.840 --> 01:20.060
and scalability to your projects.

01:20.390 --> 01:26.900
The takeaway after completing this course is the skills to be able to design and develop unity projects

01:26.900 --> 01:28.830
using MVC architecture.

01:28.850 --> 01:33.980
Throughout the duration of this course, we're going to be focusing on three different learning tracks.

01:34.370 --> 01:40.100
Whether we're talking about design fundamentals, the unity architectures will be discussing, or the

01:40.100 --> 01:41.530
Unity engine itself.

01:41.540 --> 01:45.860
We'll look at the theory, we'll look at the editor and we'll look at game code.

01:45.860 --> 01:52.220
With C-sharp, there will be course prerequisites, it suggested before beginning this course that you

01:52.220 --> 01:54.230
follow along with the software.

01:54.230 --> 01:59.390
All of the software that's required is linked to in this course and the resources section, and it's

01:59.390 --> 02:00.620
all freely available.

02:00.620 --> 02:05.990
That includes having your favorite web browser for searching different links that will be given using

02:05.990 --> 02:10.970
the Unity Editor, which has a free version and using your favorite C-sharp code editor.

02:10.970 --> 02:14.210
You can use the free one that is included with the unity download.

02:14.210 --> 02:17.930
The required knowledge for this course is not for beginners.

02:17.930 --> 02:23.230
It suggested that you have several months or more of experience with Unity and C-sharp.

02:23.300 --> 02:31.070
This includes classes, interfaces, methods and properties, how to use events, and the general paradigms

02:31.070 --> 02:33.110
of object oriented programming.

02:33.110 --> 02:39.140
If you don't have a strong knowledge of those particular elements, it suggested that you go gain that

02:39.140 --> 02:41.330
knowledge before attempting this course.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.750
Let's take a look at the course contents to see what we'll cover throughout the sections and chapters

02:46.750 --> 02:47.240
here.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.820
We'll start with the course introduction, which is this section here.

02:50.830 --> 02:55.390
Then we'll have a brief overview of unity, taking a look at how and why you would choose the Unity

02:55.390 --> 02:59.390
Game engine, as well as an overview of unity structure.

02:59.410 --> 03:05.560
Now, while this course focuses on using MVC architecture, we spend some time with the fundamentals

03:05.560 --> 03:12.610
here in software design will take a look at design principles, design patterns, UML diagramming,

03:12.610 --> 03:15.760
as well as the architecture specifically for unity.

03:15.850 --> 03:22.240
This section gives you a background to understand the concepts that will carry on into the architecture

03:22.240 --> 03:27.100
section while the course will mention several different architectures compatible with unity.

03:27.130 --> 03:30.880
We'll move forward using a particular framework that I created.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.790
The mini MVC framework.

03:33.970 --> 03:40.900
The mini MVCs for Unity is a great framework to use for production as well as educational purposes,

03:40.900 --> 03:43.630
and it's for that reason that I focus on it here in the course.

03:43.810 --> 03:50.170
The fundamentals that you learn here will help you regardless of which end framework you choose or if

03:50.170 --> 03:54.910
you choose to create your own MVC framework With the principles that we've learned here after learning

03:54.910 --> 04:00.910
how and why we would choose an architecture and why MVC is a great choice we'll look at for particular

04:00.910 --> 04:01.690
examples.

04:01.690 --> 04:07.450
This is the section of the course where I'll share my screen and I will step through three different

04:07.450 --> 04:09.320
projects that I've already created.

04:09.340 --> 04:14.440
These projects are available for you to download and follow along in the course, and there'll be assignments

04:14.440 --> 04:15.850
for you to do just that.

04:16.180 --> 04:24.130
Here we'll look at a clock created with MVC, a simple login with MVC, a3d Rollerball sample game,

04:24.130 --> 04:26.450
as well as a custom sample project.

04:26.470 --> 04:31.540
Now those first three will step through and look at the existing project, how we would accomplish it

04:31.540 --> 04:35.290
without MVC and then using the MVC framework.

04:35.290 --> 04:39.160
Both versions of that are available for you to inspect as well.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.360
For that fourth sample.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.270
It's the only section where I will code as I go.

04:43.270 --> 04:45.040
It will be a live coding section.

04:45.040 --> 04:49.810
I will start with the MVC framework and I will build a brand new example.

04:49.810 --> 04:54.280
On top of that, here are all of the concepts and practices that we learned up to this point in the

04:54.280 --> 04:57.850
course will come together in one live coding session.

04:57.850 --> 05:03.280
We'll see in the course, especially in the fundamentals, that one of the fantastic reasons to adopt

05:03.280 --> 05:09.610
architectures like MVC is that it separates your code up into nice organized areas.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.290
And a benefit of that is that you can then employ unit testing.

05:14.290 --> 05:19.900
So we will, as a bonus, cover some unit testing and test driven development content.
