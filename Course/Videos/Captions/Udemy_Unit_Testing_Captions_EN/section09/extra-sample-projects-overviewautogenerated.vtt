Hello and welcome.

00:01.490 --> 00:05.940
I've spent some time to add even more content and I'm going to go over it today.

00:05.960 --> 00:06.620
Great.

00:06.650 --> 00:13.520
What I wanted to do in this talk is go through some advanced topics and advanced demos that I've created.

00:14.090 --> 00:17.150
So we'll go through them one by one and let's see what we got here.

00:17.150 --> 00:24.140
If you're using unity for 2 or 3 years full time, even on production projects, you'll find that even

00:24.140 --> 00:30.500
as the best minds come together and work on projects bringing some best practices to it, it still becomes

00:30.500 --> 00:37.160
a challenge to organize your projects in a way that can scale, that can be testable, that can be maintainable.

00:37.160 --> 00:42.380
Even if you're kind of new to the concepts of MVC, you'll be able to start seeing the patterns.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.840
As I go through each of these examples.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.890
UI Toolkit How to build an in-game tutorial.

00:48.890 --> 00:53.840
You know, when you want the player to be guided through their first five minutes, learning the keys,

00:53.840 --> 00:59.480
etcetera, you know, how do you exactly add that into a game then an approach of multiple minis.

00:59.480 --> 01:04.890
So once you get used to the MVC architectural concept, we usually think of having one of those in the

01:04.890 --> 01:06.300
entire project.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.590
But what if you actually want to break your project and have more than one mini in it, which you definitely

01:10.590 --> 01:11.160
can?

01:11.700 --> 01:13.710
I'll talk about data binding as well.

01:13.710 --> 01:19.740
So if you want to have a text field in your UI and then map that to where your data is stored and any

01:19.740 --> 01:26.910
time you have the user update that text, it'll automatically update the data model and the reverse.

01:26.910 --> 01:29.880
Anytime the data model updates, it'll update the UI.

01:30.060 --> 01:33.990
So looking at data binding, unity doesn't natively support that.

01:33.990 --> 01:40.680
Quite excitingly, that is available in UI toolkit for editor now and in the future.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.500
It's coming in Unity for runtime.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.910
I'm very excited about that.

01:44.910 --> 01:48.810
This is a custom approach that does some data binding.

01:48.930 --> 01:55.260
Then we'll look at a simple game, this bouncy ball game, and then starting from the top we'll look

01:55.260 --> 01:56.130
at a calculator.

01:56.130 --> 01:59.790
And this count up example is very introductory ways to take a look.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.450
So we'll start from the top there with the calculator.

02:03.450 --> 02:05.130
So let's jump into unity here.
