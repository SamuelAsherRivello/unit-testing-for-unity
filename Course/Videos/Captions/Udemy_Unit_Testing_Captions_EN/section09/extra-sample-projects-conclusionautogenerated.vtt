So that's it for taking a look at more content in this particular area of the course.

00:06.530 --> 00:13.970
With many MVCs, you're able to architect more scalable solutions that are maintainable, bring that

00:13.970 --> 00:20.720
knowledge to a large team and be able to collaborate with workflows that are consistent and help futureproof

00:20.750 --> 00:21.800
your project.

00:21.830 --> 00:28.190
Here in this series, we've looked at lots of different types of demo scenes that are all included in

00:28.190 --> 00:30.140
the free git repo.

00:30.170 --> 00:32.360
There's lots of extra content included.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.700
We've got over 10 or 15 sample projects that are included in that free repo, so you can take a look

00:37.700 --> 00:38.240
at them.

00:38.450 --> 00:39.770
So that's it.

00:39.770 --> 00:43.370
Thanks very much and best wishes on your projects.
