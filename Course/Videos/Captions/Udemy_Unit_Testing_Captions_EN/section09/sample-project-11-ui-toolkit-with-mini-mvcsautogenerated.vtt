WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:01.390
All right.

00:01.390 --> 00:02.830
So welcome back.

00:04.350 --> 00:04.860
Here.

00:04.860 --> 00:13.140
We're going to take a look at a demo of using mini MVCs, which is an architecture for unity and using

00:13.140 --> 00:15.540
it along with UI toolkit.

00:18.380 --> 00:24.890
So this is part of a course that's available for pay MVC architecture for unity.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.170
It covers model view controller and the link is below.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.410
You can find out more about the course.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.820
See if it's for you.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.860
Watch the trailer for it as well.

00:33.890 --> 00:39.080
Here we're going to be talking about more content that's added on top of the experience.

00:39.080 --> 00:45.020
So in the core course we cover Unity software design, all different aspects.

00:45.020 --> 00:51.170
Mini MVC for Unity, which is one particular framework that I recommend and all the different sample

00:51.170 --> 00:52.550
projects along with it.

00:53.030 --> 00:57.590
What I've done, what I've done here is added even more demos.

00:57.590 --> 01:03.680
The course recently reached 6 or 7000 students, which I'm super excited about, so I've added lots

01:03.680 --> 01:05.360
of new content on top of it.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.940
And what we've got here is one demo about using UI toolkit.

01:09.950 --> 01:17.210
So UI toolkit, if you don't know it is the newest, it is now in Unity 2022 and beyond.

01:17.240 --> 01:22.830
The default UI that comes in not in a package but built in.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.140
And it's not the most popular yet.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.690
Unity UI continues to be pretty popular.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.770
It's been around for 5 or 6 years, but UI Toolkit is an incredibly powerful new system for doing all

01:34.770 --> 01:35.550
your UI.

01:35.580 --> 01:42.930
So we're just going to take a look at an example here of using UI toolkit in the mini MVC project.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.370
So let's take a look here.

01:46.370 --> 01:55.040
Here we are inside the project, and this is the mini MVCs free repo that is available on Git.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.190
There's a link in the chat link below that you can take a look at.

01:58.190 --> 02:03.820
And in it you can click the samples and import the samples here and follow along.

02:03.830 --> 02:07.250
Now, that's already been done here for the sake of this demo.

02:07.250 --> 02:12.650
And we can see here in the more folder, we've got all sorts of different stuff and the very last,

02:12.650 --> 02:20.990
the 10th one that we're going to have covered in the series is the Mini Mini Incorporated with UI toolkit.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.800
So here I've got let's look at all the different stuff we've got.

02:25.830 --> 02:29.010
We've got a resources folder that's got some stuff inside of it.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.900
We've got the scene, which I'll run in a moment and then we've got the source code.

02:32.910 --> 02:35.640
Notice the source code in best practices.

02:35.640 --> 02:42.090
For many, it is divided into controller model service and view.

02:42.450 --> 02:45.120
So let's go ahead and run the Mini.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.860
Load that up and let's take a look at playing this example.

02:52.310 --> 02:55.100
So here we have UI.

02:55.130 --> 03:01.610
If you're not familiar with UI toolkit, you may think, Oh, this is created in the normal use unity

03:01.640 --> 03:04.090
UI, but let's take a look at how it's structured.

03:04.100 --> 03:10.580
So each of these elements here is a button and notice that they have a consistent mouse over.

03:12.200 --> 03:12.920
Really nice.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.160
And I'll click a hare button and it changes his hair.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.820
Click the face button.

03:21.890 --> 03:23.540
The shirt button.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.450
It's just stepping through some different graphics.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.590
The body itself can change.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.310
You can randomize.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.900
And you can reset to the original.

03:34.500 --> 03:41.160
Now, the entire UI here is created in UI toolkit, so we'll take a moment and look at that and then

03:41.160 --> 03:45.060
we'll jump in and we'll focus on the the mini experience.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.810
So let's look at the scene structure here.

03:49.110 --> 03:52.470
So here in the world, let me close this up.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.150
Yeah.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.860
So here in the world, we just have the main camera and the light.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.210
Nothing too exciting there.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.700
So I just put them in that empty world object.

04:05.730 --> 04:09.390
Then we have the view here, which is the UI toolkit view.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.740
We'll look at that in a moment.

04:10.740 --> 04:14.220
And then we have the example for the Mini itself.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.670
So there's two parts to showing this demo here in this video.

04:17.700 --> 04:21.060
There's the UI toolkit part and then the mini part.

04:21.090 --> 04:28.500
Now actually, if you're familiar with Mini, there's really nothing new happening here as far as how

04:28.500 --> 04:29.430
that structures work.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.900
So we will take a dip in there.

04:30.900 --> 04:36.300
But the interesting thing here that's kind of new for a lot of unity users is just how the UI is set

04:36.300 --> 04:36.750
up.

04:36.780 --> 04:46.320
So what I do here is I have a UI document which is right here and UI document is a core unity class.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.140
Let me pop myself over here for a second.

04:49.170 --> 04:56.380
The unity UI is a core class part of UI toolkit and it takes a visual tree asset.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.930
So if we look at our project here.

05:02.550 --> 05:05.340
I'm already lost where I click that.

05:05.340 --> 05:08.790
Click, click.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.290
Here we go.

05:10.500 --> 05:18.250
So in this UI toolkit mini demo, there is a UI toolkit folder and it has some settings in it.

05:18.270 --> 05:22.470
It has the cascading style sheets which are called us.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.080
It has the UI toolkit layout.

05:25.110 --> 05:28.260
Now it's the layout that determines what's on the screen.

05:28.290 --> 05:34.410
Now I have other videos linked below and you can take a look at how UI toolkit works, how and why it's

05:34.410 --> 05:39.870
super cool, how it's based on web standards like CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.690
But let's just open this up so you can take a quick look.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.920
Make it full screen here.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.320
I'll click this.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.140
There we go.

05:47.740 --> 05:51.580
So we can see here we see which side is better for me to be on.

05:51.580 --> 05:58.030
I'll pop back over here so you can see here it looks kind of like the whole unity editor here and what

05:58.030 --> 05:58.600
we're looking at.

05:58.600 --> 06:05.080
But this is actually one layout window inside Unity because the UI toolkit system and its UI builder

06:05.080 --> 06:07.980
window here has lots of information.

06:07.990 --> 06:11.440
We've got all the different styles represented on the left.

06:11.470 --> 06:16.780
We've got a hierarchy of the structure here that is just the hierarchy of the view.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.390
You can see we can click across all the different items.

06:20.430 --> 06:20.970
Member.

06:20.970 --> 06:25.600
If I click preview here, I can see the different mouse over states.

06:25.620 --> 06:30.380
Let's just take a quick peek at one of the benefits of using us.

06:30.420 --> 06:37.380
If I wanted to change this from getting bigger and turning blue as we mouse over, what if we wanted

06:37.380 --> 06:39.210
it to go smaller and green?

06:39.300 --> 06:44.010
Just for an arbitrary example, I've got a style here for when the button hovers.

06:47.270 --> 06:53.600
And if I go down here to color, I'll change it green.

06:53.840 --> 06:59.540
And then I go down to the transform and I'll change it to 0.98 and 0.98.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.560
So now I'm going green and smaller.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.270
Now let's do the preview again and mouse over.

07:05.270 --> 07:10.190
Now look, all of those consistently change their over states.

07:10.220 --> 07:16.850
Now doing the same thing in the traditional unity UI system is very possible, but it has never been

07:16.850 --> 07:24.320
more easy to have templated effects that go over the pseudo states of mouse hover.

07:24.320 --> 07:24.860
Selected.

07:24.860 --> 07:25.610
ET cetera.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.180
Built in.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.380
Very, very nice.

07:27.380 --> 07:32.930
So the point there is that that system is super cool, but we're not going to go into depth with that.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.350
Let's now take a look at we pop back over here.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.510
Pop back over here.

07:43.230 --> 07:48.810
We'll take just a minute here and go through how the Mini is set up.

07:49.020 --> 07:54.390
So in that scene, we create some of the mini concerns.

07:54.390 --> 07:58.530
We create the context, the model, the service and the controller.

07:58.560 --> 08:03.990
Now, as we've seen in a lot of other demos in the course and you can watch different videos on YouTube

08:03.990 --> 08:08.820
about this that I've covered, the controller is really the glue that brings it all together.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.620
So let's take a look at how that works.

08:11.750 --> 08:20.720
So here what we do is we initialize and we say, Hey, model, maintain an int that represents the index

08:20.720 --> 08:26.720
of which hair we've got on and it'll be zero one, two, three, four, depending on the hair for the

08:26.720 --> 08:29.180
face, for the shirt, for the body.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.960
So all of those different elements are stored in the model and we listen to them here.

08:32.960 --> 08:40.880
And any time the model says, Oh, the user has advanced which body to to use, we just grab the next

08:40.880 --> 08:43.160
reference to a sprite and we use that there.

08:43.670 --> 08:48.080
Then down here, any time the view changes.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.040
So if we click the hair button, then we're going to handle that.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.470
The hair button has been clicked.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.990
Anytime the face button gets clicked, we'll handle that stuff here.

08:56.990 --> 09:03.530
So we're handling changing things, affecting the rendering of the view and also listening back then

09:03.530 --> 09:04.490
down here.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.470
Let's just see what happens.

09:06.470 --> 09:16.920
Anytime we click any of the buttons here, we go down here and we change the different value that is

09:16.920 --> 09:18.960
stored inside the data model.

09:18.960 --> 09:24.390
So if you click next hair, please, then it updates that inside the model.

09:24.940 --> 09:25.450
All right.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.210
So that's it.

09:26.260 --> 09:31.390
There's one thing that I did want to look at here, which if I go back here and I see that when I create

09:31.390 --> 09:32.890
The view.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.290
Uh, don't create it here.

09:36.290 --> 09:37.450
Actually, yeah.

09:37.730 --> 09:38.480
I took a you.

09:40.970 --> 09:48.320
So here we have a public property for each of the buttons in that UI.

09:48.350 --> 09:54.520
Now, typically you would have these be serialized fields for each button in Unity UI.

09:54.530 --> 09:59.270
But we're going to do something uniquely different here because we're using UI toolkit.

09:59.420 --> 10:08.390
UI Toolkit has a query language where you can type Q and get any named element, and if you want it

10:08.390 --> 10:13.790
strongly typed, you can do Q button and then give it the name you want.

10:13.820 --> 10:19.270
So you can see here in that syntax that I'm able to get at the Hare button.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.720
Now let's just look double check where that's named, that's named in the layout itself.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.150
So when I brought up that big window and showed.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.150
How everything is designed there.

10:29.180 --> 10:34.160
Then they you give them your own custom name and here I use it.

10:34.190 --> 10:38.540
Now sometimes you'll see them named like hair button like that.

10:38.540 --> 10:42.890
Borrowing from kind of a web world web standards way.

10:42.890 --> 10:51.860
But I continue to use the unity naming that I like like that so that's really the only other thing I

10:51.860 --> 10:52.580
want to show.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.780
Let's run the scene again.

10:54.950 --> 10:55.590
There we go.

10:55.610 --> 11:04.460
So I click here, I click face neck shirt, put body, click the reset button, and everything works

11:04.460 --> 11:04.950
there.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.900
So it looked a little bit jittery there, but I think it's working really great.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.720
So thanks very much for watching this video.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.680
And that's it.
