Hello and welcome to Unit Testing for unity.

00:03.110 --> 00:04.010
Lessons.

00:04.040 --> 00:07.800
Unit testing is both an art and a science.

00:07.820 --> 00:14.150
When we describe something being an art, it's where each person leaves their own fingerprint on the

00:14.150 --> 00:15.040
process.

00:15.050 --> 00:21.740
Whereas when we think of science, we think of something objective, something that can be universal,

00:21.770 --> 00:25.310
eternal, and applied consistently over a process.

00:25.340 --> 00:32.180
This lesson section will help you to learn the science of unit testing, as well as ideas on how you

00:32.180 --> 00:35.120
can put your own artistic fingerprint of your own now.

00:35.150 --> 00:39.990
Typically, we think of software development or computer science as a science.

00:40.010 --> 00:46.040
We think of the rules of mathematics and physics that come into game development as being universally

00:46.040 --> 00:46.820
applied.

00:47.180 --> 00:54.380
However, I would say, particularly in game development, as a subgenre of software development, the

00:54.380 --> 01:02.060
process of what the user experience is and the dynamic changes that we expect when we blend different

01:02.060 --> 01:07.280
game genres, we're surprising and subverting user expectations.

01:07.310 --> 01:13.310
That creative and organic process also applies to the software development process of creating those

01:13.310 --> 01:14.150
games.

01:14.180 --> 01:22.340
Now, overall, I consider computer science to be more of a science, more of these objective processes

01:22.340 --> 01:24.670
than necessarily a creative one.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.780
But there's different areas and different ways that we can look at the subsystems and the tasks that

01:29.780 --> 01:32.150
we have within unit testing.

01:32.150 --> 01:37.850
I want to be playful with the idea that there are definitely best practices or the science that we can

01:37.850 --> 01:45.080
learn here, but there's also so many different ways that you can design your systems that you can meet

01:45.080 --> 01:46.970
the user's expectations.

01:46.970 --> 01:53.210
You may be blending different techniques for a end user experience and blending different techniques

01:53.210 --> 01:55.210
for how you create the systems.

01:55.220 --> 02:01.610
Also, we're all imperfect as game developers, so we know we're going to be growing along the way.

02:01.610 --> 02:08.840
And I think noticing that we can be subjective, we can make playful decisions along the way and learn

02:08.840 --> 02:09.650
from it.

02:09.980 --> 02:16.520
That artful style, I hope, makes you a bit more comfortable to stick your toe into these waters and

02:16.520 --> 02:18.140
to learn more unit testing.

02:18.140 --> 02:24.620
So as you go through this course and you look at these lessons, I'll be adding more content over time

02:24.620 --> 02:32.450
and revisiting this balancing act between the art side and the creative side, as well as the more technical

02:32.450 --> 02:33.590
scientific side.

02:33.590 --> 02:35.690
Now let's get started with the lessons.
