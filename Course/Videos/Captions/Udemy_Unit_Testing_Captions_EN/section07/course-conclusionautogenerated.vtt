00:00.090 --> 00:00.570
The course.

00:00.570 --> 00:05.530
Conclusion I hope you've enjoyed this course about NVQ architecture.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.270
As much as I've enjoyed sharing it, we know that unity is a versatile engine and a perfect tool for

00:12.270 --> 00:20.160
creating great games using architectures like MVCs Brings confidence, organization and scalability

00:20.160 --> 00:21.180
to your projects.

00:21.180 --> 00:28.020
This course is designed such that the takeaway is that now you're confident to design and develop projects

00:28.020 --> 00:30.270
using Unity and MVCs.

00:30.270 --> 00:36.780
Every decision we make in software, be it the technology, the process or the people, can be viewed

00:36.780 --> 00:38.430
as a form of investment.

00:38.430 --> 00:43.970
Each investment comes with a cost, but we trust that these decisions will ultimately pay off.

00:43.980 --> 00:49.950
That's very much how I recommend we look at architectures you've invested in yourself by completing

00:49.950 --> 00:50.790
this course.

00:50.790 --> 00:52.500
Your projects and your team will.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.070
Thank you.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.340
In summary, unity is a great platform for us to use.

00:56.340 --> 01:02.130
We've seen that developers spend most of their time on the maintenance of existing code and that architecture

01:02.130 --> 01:07.470
can help developers create projects with confidence, performance and scalability.

01:07.470 --> 01:10.680
MVC architectures are proven solutions.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.480
They've stood the test of time.

01:12.480 --> 01:18.570
They help produce more testable projects and lead to faster development and better maintenance.

01:18.570 --> 01:25.890
And we've seen that the Mini and VCs framework is ideal for production as well as educational purposes.

01:25.890 --> 01:33.000
Some suggested next steps are to dive deeper into the design principles and design patterns we covered

01:33.000 --> 01:33.840
in this course.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.440
Bring MVC architecture into your current Unity project and your next projects as well.

01:39.450 --> 01:45.390
I encourage you to check out other MVC frameworks for Unity so you can learn even more in this course.

01:45.390 --> 01:50.760
We've covered a lot of concepts from high level theory right down into the code.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.980
It's important that the learning doesn't end here.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.890
Practice, practice and practice more.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.100
Thank you very much for participating in the course.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.900

02:00.930 --> 02:04.470
I have over 20 years of experience in game development.

02:04.470 --> 02:10.950
It's my mission to educate and entertain with interactive technology and it's been my pleasure to share

02:10.950 --> 02:12.210
this course with you.

02:12.210 --> 02:17.820
