00:00.230 --> 00:01.180
The unity.

00:01.190 --> 00:02.270
Overview.

00:02.780 --> 00:09.100
The games industry is big and getting bigger amongst leisure time activities.

00:09.110 --> 00:16.910
Playing interactive experiences like video games has become increasingly popular on a weekly basis.

00:16.940 --> 00:20.150
It makes up the most of these activities.

00:20.300 --> 00:26.070
The size of the global game development industry is tremendously big.

00:26.090 --> 00:30.860
You can see across different continents the size of the global game market.

00:30.890 --> 00:36.620
There's many ways that game development teams can solve the challenges of developing games.

00:36.620 --> 00:42.710
Choosing a middleware a real time engine like unity brings a lot of features and services to a game

00:42.710 --> 00:46.340
development team, and allows you to create content more quickly.

00:46.370 --> 00:52.610
Unity is an industry leading choice for over a decade, and you can create content that is 2D, 3D,

00:52.640 --> 00:56.450
VR, AR across all different sorts of industries.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.840
Gaming, of course, but also architecture, simulation and feature films.

01:01.850 --> 01:04.470
Unity is the name of the company.

01:04.490 --> 01:09.680
Its services, the platform you build on, and the runtime engine itself.

01:09.710 --> 01:14.420
Unity is just one development platform you can choose from, but it's tremendously popular.

01:14.450 --> 01:20.300
Of the top 1000 performing mobile games, over 70% are created with unity.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.940
Unity is created with everyone in mind.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.050
Let's see more.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.970
Here's a screenshot from a popular type of game.

02:19.970 --> 02:23.990
We can see here some of the essentials of video game development.

02:23.990 --> 02:28.670
There's UI, these on screen elements text and the minimap.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.130
These things make up the user interface.

02:31.430 --> 02:38.720
There's the input taking input from finger swipes on a mobile device, gamepad controllers on a console,

02:38.750 --> 02:39.830
mouse, and keyboard.

02:39.830 --> 02:44.930
On PC, there's rendering the audio and the graphics, of course, to the user.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.160
These can be 2D or 3D, and these elements can be animated.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.560
There's many different types of animations in video game development, from the screen fading in and

02:54.560 --> 02:57.290
out to the way the character walks around the world.

02:57.290 --> 03:01.340
And finally, there's the scripting or coding that you do in unity.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.230
That's the C-sharp programming language.

03:03.230 --> 03:06.580
So when we think of unity, what are the features that are built in?

03:06.590 --> 03:11.720
Well, by choosing unity as the middleware solution, you get a lot of features out of the box.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.480
All the ones I just talked about and much, much more.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.590
In addition to these features, there's also optional services.

03:18.890 --> 03:26.180
Unity provides different services for acquiring and measuring your users, providing back end functionality

03:26.180 --> 03:27.830
as well as multiplayer.

03:28.250 --> 03:33.290
Overall, game teams can choose the tools and platforms that make sense for them.

03:33.940 --> 03:39.670
Creating your own game engine is possible, but requires tremendous resources in a larger team.

03:39.820 --> 03:46.210
The end result may be more customizable, however, choosing something off the shelf like unity, which

03:46.210 --> 03:53.710
brings these features and services, allows teams to offer end users much more content more quickly.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.400
And of the choices out there.

03:55.420 --> 04:01.630
Unity is among the most powerful and popular options we've seen that the games industry is big and it's

04:01.630 --> 04:02.350
growing.

04:02.530 --> 04:08.560
Unity is a powerful option to choose and includes features and services out of the box.

04:08.590 --> 04:14.030
Next, we'll continue looking at unity, particularly its structure and organization.

04:14.050 --> 04:14.890
Thanks.
