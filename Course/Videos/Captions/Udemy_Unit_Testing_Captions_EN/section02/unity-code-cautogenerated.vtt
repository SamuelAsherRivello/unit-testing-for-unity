00:00.240 --> 00:06.180
Editors are some of the main tools we use in software development when developing games with unity.

00:06.180 --> 00:12.840
The Unity editor itself is where we do most of our work, and then a separate code editor is where we

00:12.840 --> 00:13.590
add the code.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.380
The Unity editor is made up of a concept of a layout, which is a group of different tabbed and docked

00:19.380 --> 00:20.220
windows.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.920
And each of these windows performs functions and gives us more information about the game and project

00:26.920 --> 00:27.700
we're creating.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.910
Here's a fairly common layout with the most popular and useful windows.

00:31.930 --> 00:35.070
The hierarchy window shows us the objects in the world.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.860
The scene view gives us a 3D representation of that world.

00:38.950 --> 00:42.100
It can also be toggled to 2D for 2D gameplay.

00:42.130 --> 00:48.130
The project window represents the library of all possible assets and code we can bring into that scene.

00:48.130 --> 00:54.550
And as we select on different items and functionality in these windows, the Inspector window gives

00:54.550 --> 00:58.480
us more detail and serialized fields from our code.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.320
Show up here for easy editing and edit time and runtime.

01:02.350 --> 01:05.200
Let's see this in action within the Unity editor.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.580
I'll create a new scene.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.340
I'll create a game object.

01:08.350 --> 01:11.530
I'll add a custom script to that game object.

01:11.530 --> 01:15.970
I'll press play in unity and we'll see how that script translates into runtime.

01:15.970 --> 01:21.460
And then I'll play with the serialized fields inside the inspector to demonstrate how that works.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.780
The prerequisites for this course include some free software.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.350
First, use whatever is your favorite web browser.

01:30.270 --> 01:35.280
This is helpful to do any additional research you need to do along with the course.

01:35.850 --> 01:38.460
For example, you can get Chrome by Google.

01:38.490 --> 01:41.070
Next, we'll need the Unity editor itself.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.790
The Unity editor also comes with a code editor.

01:45.180 --> 01:50.760
Or you can use whatever code editor you like from the getting started button at the top nav.

01:50.790 --> 01:55.350
We find different choices and prices for the Unity Software package.

01:55.350 --> 02:02.040
The options include Unity, personal and Unity student, both of which are free and recommended for

02:02.040 --> 02:03.220
use in this course.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.340
These include all the features and functionality that we talked about and everything you'll need to

02:08.340 --> 02:09.950
learn from this course as well.

02:09.960 --> 02:16.680
When we first download and run Unity in an open, empty project, we'll have that familiar layout and

02:16.680 --> 02:19.280
series of windows we saw before.

02:19.290 --> 02:20.760
Let's create a new scene.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.690
We can do this in many ways, but simply file new scene.

02:24.690 --> 02:28.260
We'll choose the basic built in scene and in the hierarchy.

02:28.260 --> 02:32.850
We can see we have the basic scene set up with the default camera and lighting.

02:32.850 --> 02:34.410
Let's create a new game object.

02:34.410 --> 02:39.000
We'll choose the cube and then put some custom scripting on the cube.

02:39.030 --> 02:44.240
There's many ways we can do that, but we'll choose Game Object, 3D Object and Cube.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.760
Now we can see that cube rendering in the game view.

02:47.790 --> 02:52.050
The game view represents what the end users will see from the game camera.

02:52.050 --> 02:58.410
With that cube selected in the hierarchy, we can see in the inspector window all of the current components

02:58.410 --> 02:59.190
attached.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.590
We'll add a new custom component.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.270
Now in our project window, we see the first asset we've created.

03:11.010 --> 03:15.000
We can double click that script and open it in the default code editor.

03:15.700 --> 03:21.190
When we create a new script and we open it, the default code editor opens for us.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.480
And to get you started, unity includes a small bit of template code.

03:25.630 --> 03:30.550
You're free to remove the parts that you don't want or need and begin coding from scratch.

03:31.030 --> 03:35.240
All copy from our scripting slide and paste that into unity.

03:35.260 --> 03:40.990
We have the awake method, the start method, and the update method that's going to run every frame.

03:41.830 --> 03:45.100
Here I'm using the transform component to rotate the object.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.680
We save our script here and return to unity and we'll run the scene.

03:48.700 --> 03:56.150
You can see at runtime that that transform rotate code inside the update method is spinning that cube.

03:56.170 --> 04:02.890
Also, while Unity is running here with the cube selected, I see the serialized field of speed and

04:02.890 --> 04:04.030
I can manipulate it.

04:12.970 --> 04:15.490
Now it's spinning much, much faster.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.800
Or much slower.

04:28.760 --> 04:35.840
We're able to make these changes to any serialized fields so we can tweak the gameplay feel or game

04:35.840 --> 04:38.420
design without stopping unity.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.480
This is an incredibly powerful feature of the unity engine.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.670
The Unity editor shows us an approximation of our game and development.

04:48.270 --> 04:52.650
It's best to test it in a full build to see the real results.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.360
There's many ways to do that, but I'll use file, build and run.

04:56.370 --> 05:00.510
And now we see our project running in a standalone build.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.660
In my case, that's set for Windows.

05:03.690 --> 05:09.360
That's it for a brief overview of Unity, adding scripting and building the project.

05:10.920 --> 05:19.110
With that quick overview of unity, the unity ed and scripting, we can begin to see how powerful unity

05:19.110 --> 05:19.600
is.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.820
We're only scratching the surface with what's possible.

05:22.830 --> 05:27.120
We've reviewed the theory editor and Coding Inside Unity.

05:27.120 --> 05:33.210
We've seen the game object is a fundamental concept that prefabs and scenes are used for high level

05:33.210 --> 05:38.970
organization in your project and that by creating a class and extending mono behavior, we get a lot

05:38.970 --> 05:40.810
of functionality out of the box.

05:40.830 --> 05:47.130
Next, we'll take a step back from the specifics of unity and look at some software design concepts.

05:47.130 --> 05:56.040
We'll look at design principles, design patterns, and UML or unified modeling language for diagramming

05:56.040 --> 05:57.630
our concepts and plans.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.170
Thank you.
