00:00.450 --> 00:02.370
The unity overview.

00:02.850 --> 00:09.180
The games industry is big and getting bigger amongst leisure time activities.

00:09.180 --> 00:15.210
Playing interactive experiences like video games has become increasingly popular.

00:15.450 --> 00:20.220
On a weekly basis, it makes up the most of these activities.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.150
The size of the global game development industry is tremendously big.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.990
You can see across different continents the size of the global game market.

00:30.990 --> 00:36.720
There's many ways that game development teams can solve the challenges of developing games.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.810
Choosing a middleware, a real time engine like Unity brings a lot of features and services to a game

00:42.810 --> 00:46.480
development team and allows you to create content more quickly.

00:46.500 --> 00:52.320
Unity is an industry leading choice for over a decade, and you can create content that is 2D three

00:52.320 --> 00:56.550
D, VR AR across all different sorts of industries.

00:56.580 --> 01:01.940
Gaming, of course, but also architecture, simulation, action and feature films.

01:01.950 --> 01:09.830
Unity is the name of the company, its services, the platform you build on and the runtime engine itself.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.520
Unity is just one development platform you can choose from, but it's tremendously popular.

01:14.520 --> 01:20.340
Of the top 1000 performing mobile games, over 70% are created with unity.

01:20.610 --> 01:23.040
Unity is created with everyone in mind.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.150
Let's see more.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.070
Here's a screenshot from a popular type of game.

02:20.070 --> 02:24.090
We can see here some of the essentials of video game development.

02:24.090 --> 02:28.810
There's UI, these on screen elements, text and the minimap.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.200
These things make up the user interface.

02:31.560 --> 02:38.850
There's the input taking input from finger swipes on a mobile device, gamepad controllers on a console

02:38.850 --> 02:40.800
mouse and keyboard on PC.

02:40.830 --> 02:44.970
There's rendering the audio and the graphics, of course, to the user.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.240
These can be two D or three D, and these elements can be animated.

02:49.260 --> 02:55.110
There's many different types of animations in video game development from the screen fading in and out

02:55.110 --> 02:57.410
to the way the character walks around the world.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.600
And finally there's the scripting or coding that you do.

03:00.690 --> 03:03.330
In Unity, that's the C-sharp programming language.

03:03.330 --> 03:06.700
So when we think of unity, what are the features that are built in?

03:06.720 --> 03:11.820
Well, by choosing Unity as the middleware solution, you get a lot of features out of the box.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.610
All the ones I just talked about and much, much more.

03:14.610 --> 03:18.630
In addition to these features, there's also optional services.

03:19.050 --> 03:26.280
Unity provides different services for acquiring and measuring your users, providing backend functionality

03:26.280 --> 03:27.870
as well as multiplayer.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.300
Overall game teams can choose the tools and platforms that make sense for them.

03:34.060 --> 03:39.730
Creating your own game engine is possible, but requires tremendous resources in a larger team.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.670
The end result may be more customizable.

03:42.880 --> 03:49.450
However, choosing something off the shelf like Unity, which brings these features and services, allows

03:49.450 --> 03:55.460
teams to offer end users much more content more quickly and of the choices out there.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.990
Unity is among the most powerful and popular options.

03:58.990 --> 04:02.410
We've seen that the games industry is big and it's growing.

04:02.650 --> 04:08.650
Unity is a powerful option to choose and includes features and services out of the box.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.110
Next, we'll continue looking at unity, particularly its structure and organization.

04:14.110 --> 04:14.980
Thanks.
