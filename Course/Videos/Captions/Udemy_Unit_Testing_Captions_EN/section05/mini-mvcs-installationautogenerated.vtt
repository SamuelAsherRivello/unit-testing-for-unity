00:00.390 --> 00:03.270
Installation of the mini MVCs.

00:04.310 --> 00:06.980
The full source code is available free on git.

00:07.010 --> 00:08.870
The link will be included below.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.880
The steps for installation is to follow that link.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.850
Create a new unity project.

00:13.850 --> 00:19.610
I suggest the latest loads of unity and then you import this package into your project.

00:19.610 --> 00:27.410
Within Unity's top menu you navigate Window Package Manager Add package from git URL and you use the

00:27.410 --> 00:29.120
URL atop the git page.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.640
Here we are in our favorite web browser.

00:31.640 --> 00:37.460
Looking at the project repo In GitHub, we click code and we can see the full git URL.

00:37.490 --> 00:39.950
You want to copy that and bring that into unity.

00:39.980 --> 00:44.840
Here we are in an empty unity project using the latest version of unity.

00:45.690 --> 00:47.490
We'll open up the package manager.

00:58.370 --> 01:03.970
The package manager shows all of the current dependencies and allows you to add more.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.500
We hit the plus button and choose to add a new git URL.

01:07.520 --> 01:13.970
We paste in the URL we got from the github repo and now the mini MVCs is successfully added into your

01:13.970 --> 01:14.540
project.

01:14.540 --> 01:20.000
Notice in the project window that we have nothing in assets in this particular example because it's

01:20.000 --> 01:24.440
an empty project and under packages we can see many MVCs.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.780
So it's a bit off the subject, but I'll talk a little bit about unity and packages.

01:30.780 --> 01:34.590
Historically, Unity offered assets through the asset store.

01:34.620 --> 01:40.470
These assets were downloaded in something like a zip file that you would unzip in your project and be

01:40.470 --> 01:41.510
able to use them.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.270
The system worked fairly well.

01:43.290 --> 01:47.750
A few years back, unity greatly expanded in how this system would be delivered.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.880
The asset store still very much exists as a concept, but now when you download things from third parties,

01:53.880 --> 01:58.290
including this package that I'm offering here, it comes through the Unity Package manager.

01:58.290 --> 02:03.120
Some benefits include you have another pathway that's very easy to add things to your project.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.050
As we've seen.

02:04.350 --> 02:08.370
You can also include as a developer samples to share with others.

02:08.370 --> 02:12.000
We'll take a look at some samples for many MVCs in later sections.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.040
Periodically as you're using this package or any others, check back into the package manager to see

02:17.040 --> 02:22.110
if a new version has been released to make sure you're always running the most updated code In this

02:22.110 --> 02:25.380
section, we've taken a look at the mini MVCs.

02:25.380 --> 02:31.980
We had an overview, talked about some of the pros and cons, some features, benefits and see that

02:31.980 --> 02:34.620
it's a lighter alternative to some other frameworks.

02:34.620 --> 02:38.540
We saw how to install it into your projects and are ready to explore more.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.020
Next, we'll dig deeper.

02:40.020 --> 02:45.420
This is going to be the first look at the real code of this framework, Learning the fundamentals through

02:45.420 --> 02:46.290
examples.

02:46.290 --> 02:52.530
We're going to see sample projects, how to take all the theory in this course and apply it to C-sharp

02:52.530 --> 02:53.120
code.

02:53.130 --> 02:59.370
Now, I know we've talked about a lot of principles, patterns, concepts, philosophies up to this

02:59.370 --> 02:59.940
point.

02:59.940 --> 03:04.230
It's all going to come together when we start to see it in the sample code.

03:04.230 --> 03:06.180
I look forward to seeing it with you.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.050
Thanks.
