00:00.200 --> 00:00.980
The course.

00:00.980 --> 00:02.060
Philosophy.

00:03.280 --> 00:10.210
This course was born out of the idea that we all start our software projects with the best of intentions,

00:10.210 --> 00:15.550
but somehow we end up with software that is difficult to scale and to maintain.

00:15.910 --> 00:23.230
It said that we don't rise to the level of our expectations, but instead we fall to the level of our

00:23.230 --> 00:23.760
training.

00:23.770 --> 00:31.390
This course is designed to give us the training to build software with confidence, performance and

00:31.390 --> 00:32.380
scalability.

00:32.410 --> 00:38.680
Completing this training and integrating it into your workflow will greatly impact the projects you

00:38.710 --> 00:41.910
create and the quality of life for you and your team.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.540
Your team will thank you.

00:44.530 --> 00:47.620
Some advice to get the most out of this course.

00:47.650 --> 00:48.950
Be active.

00:48.970 --> 00:55.870
Watch the videos as well as doing the quizzes and the assignments in the moments the course calls for

00:55.870 --> 00:56.070
it.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.840
Download the source code, follow along and play with the code experiment.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.940
Add new features and bring the theory from the course into practice within the code.

01:06.940 --> 01:09.160
This course covers a lot of topics.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.660
Feel free to take breaks whenever you need so that you get the most out of the material.

01:13.690 --> 01:16.570
Do your best to pull this information toward you.

01:16.570 --> 01:23.320
If there's concepts, topics, APIs that are mentioned that you're not familiar with, feel free to

01:23.320 --> 01:28.510
pause the video and investigate a bit on your own, and then move forward with the course.

01:28.510 --> 01:31.210
I'm really excited to share this information with you.

01:31.210 --> 01:32.410
Let's get started.
