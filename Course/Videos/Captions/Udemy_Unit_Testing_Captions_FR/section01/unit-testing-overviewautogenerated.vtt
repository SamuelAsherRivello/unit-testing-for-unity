00:00.080 --> 00:02.870
Hello and welcome to Unit Testing for unity.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.940
My name is Samuel Asher Ravello.

00:04.970 --> 00:10.130
I'm a unity developer and instructor with over 20 years of game development experience.

00:10.130 --> 00:15.720
My mission is to educate and entertain with interactive technology, including unity.

00:15.740 --> 00:22.610
I've shipped unity titles for PC, Xbox consoles, and more, and I'm available for remote contract

00:22.640 --> 00:29.390
hire as a unity game developer, a unity game instructor, as well as a product evangelist.

00:29.420 --> 00:35.660
My career experience includes being a game developer, a manager of game developers, and doing education

00:35.660 --> 00:37.120
in the game development space.

00:37.130 --> 00:44.450
My teaching experience includes universities, classroom, online, creating YouTube videos and doing

00:44.450 --> 00:49.910
videos and first time user experience analysis and overviews for clients.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.790
Our topic here is Unit Testing for unity.

00:52.820 --> 00:58.580
Unity is a versatile game engine that can be used for all sorts of industries, including, of course,

00:58.580 --> 01:06.380
game development and unit testing is a sub topic that allows you to design and test your classes and

01:06.380 --> 01:10.040
architectures so that they're more robust and maintainable.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.530
The takeaway here is that after this course, you'll think about creating your classes in a new way,

01:15.530 --> 01:21.050
and you'll think about the lifetime and the maintenance of your project as well, with more confidence

01:21.050 --> 01:27.800
enabling you to do refactors and analysis of your projects and scale them up more easily than ever before.

01:27.830 --> 01:33.110
The course is informally broken into a few different learning tracks at any given time.

01:33.110 --> 01:40.040
We'll be focusing a bit more on the theory and fundamentals behind what is the technique or topic at

01:40.070 --> 01:40.610
hand.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.860
We'll also take a look at the editor.

01:42.860 --> 01:47.630
Unique features that we can do within unity to empower us as game developers.

01:47.630 --> 01:53.600
Here we'll be talking about unit testing and using the Test Runner window withinside the unity editor.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.390
And then of course, we're going to be diving deep into code.

01:56.390 --> 02:02.090
We're going to assume that the production code that we're writing, while quite simple, is within reach

02:02.120 --> 02:03.230
of the students here.

02:03.230 --> 02:08.960
And we'll be focusing more on new testing code that accompanies our production code.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.680
This testing code will perform automatic tests on that code to give us more code confidence and security

02:15.680 --> 02:20.930
on the current state of our project, particularly when we're designing as well as doing refactors and

02:20.930 --> 02:21.650
maintenance.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.510
Let's take a look at the course prerequisites.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.490
First, there's going to be some software involved.

02:25.490 --> 02:30.650
Everything's free from unity to the code editor to opening up a web browser to do some more research

02:30.680 --> 02:31.880
as we're going along.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.040
That's easy.

02:33.050 --> 02:36.410
I include instructions in this course for how to install those things you need.

02:36.410 --> 02:39.470
And to get started, let's talk about the knowledge prerequisites.

02:39.470 --> 02:43.490
So it's important to note that this course is not for beginners.

02:43.490 --> 02:48.230
We're going to make some assumptions about object oriented programming class designs.

02:48.230 --> 02:54.320
And we'll even talk a bit about interfaces which some beginner developers are unfamiliar with here and

02:54.320 --> 02:55.190
there through the course.

02:55.190 --> 02:59.570
If there's something that you don't understand that is not part of our course curriculum, I recommend

02:59.570 --> 03:04.760
to pause the video and go check it out, maybe 5 or 10 minutes of reading and then coming back into

03:04.760 --> 03:05.180
the course.

03:05.180 --> 03:11.720
With that knowledge, we're really focusing on adding unit testing as a new layer on top of our production

03:11.720 --> 03:12.230
code.

03:12.230 --> 03:16.670
I won't go too deep into talking about production code itself, and in the course we'll be going through

03:16.670 --> 03:23.270
some simple examples as well, from something like a calculator to a simple character movement and a

03:23.270 --> 03:26.480
little bit of stuff around loading some data from an external server.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.730
Let's take a look together at the course contents.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.960
I'm going to read along.

03:30.130 --> 03:32.690
We're covering the course introduction here.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.960
There's a whole section giving a review about unity.

03:35.960 --> 03:41.570
In that section we'll look at a unity overview about why unity is a popular game engine.

03:41.570 --> 03:45.320
While the game industry is great and interesting to work within.

03:45.320 --> 03:51.200
And then we'll look at some things about the unity structure game objects, projects, scenes, things

03:51.200 --> 03:51.890
like that.

03:51.890 --> 03:56.690
For many of us, that'll be review, but I do recommend checking it out because some of the things we

03:56.690 --> 04:01.040
mentioned there will all repeat later in the course, and it's good to have that fresh connection.

04:01.550 --> 04:06.800
Then we'll do a little bit of software design, talking about some design principles and a little bit

04:06.800 --> 04:14.300
about design patterns, just so we understand the science and the art behind how we design well-performing

04:14.300 --> 04:20.150
code, so that once we begin unit testing on that, we'll be talking a bit about those efficiencies

04:20.150 --> 04:24.740
and those design principles in the unity testing fundamentals.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.320
We'll go over what is a unit test.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.820
Why do you want to do it.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.770
How do you do it inside unity.

04:30.770 --> 04:37.070
And that's going to be a step by step process to really look from a project that has no unity unit tests

04:37.070 --> 04:39.140
to adding our first unit tests.

04:39.140 --> 04:43.640
That's a great place to really get those basics solved.

04:43.670 --> 04:49.160
Then we'll move on to doing a series of workshops in the workshops, each of them is going to be a bit

04:49.160 --> 04:50.420
more free form.

04:50.540 --> 04:56.720
I'm just going to share my screen and go through the core core sample project that's included for you.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.560
And in each of those I will just.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.890
Kind of go with a stream of consciousness explaining the motivation behind it.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.620
We'll do a bit of coding as we go in some of them.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.990
Some of the workshops will be more code heavy.

05:09.020 --> 05:14.420
Other ones I'll be reviewing existing code, but throughout all of them, it's really another chance

05:14.420 --> 05:19.700
to just add another layer upon layer of comfort and familiarity with the concepts.

05:20.060 --> 05:24.800
During the workshops, I recommend to open up the sample project and follow along and here and there

05:24.800 --> 05:28.910
through the course, I'll mention that there'll be an opportunity for some advanced topics to.
